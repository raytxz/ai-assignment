    "In this week's exercise, we will apply neural networks to a new type of data - text. You will also pick your own corpus of text to play with.  **But first, some definitions** (there's a lot of new jargon in 'NLP'):\n",
    "* *Corpus*: The set of all text documents you want to work on\n",
    "* *Document*: An individual unit of text in your corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some **examples of corpora** to get you thinking:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Corpus of 100,000 IMDB reviews, where each document is an individual review\n",
    "* Corpus of 20 English novels, where each document is an individual novel\n",
    "* Corpus of one Malay novel, where each document is a chapter\n",
    "\n",
    "You can **browse for a corpus in the below links** (if you don't already have one in mind):\n",

    "* https://github.com/niderhoff/nlp-datasets\n",
    "* https://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is your first time working with text, it's probably easier to deal with a corpus of many short documents - for example the IMDB review dataset, which is linked below in Chapter 2.  Play around with several corpora over the course of week, and work with something that interests you. Remember text doesn't have to be English (try other languages), or even a natural language (try code or musical notation)!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key learning resources** for the week:\n",
    "* https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/ - legendary textbook introducing key theory and concepts of working with text, up to deep learning methods\n",
    "* http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/ - great course that introduces theory and concepts of text processing in the context of deep learning (can read class notes / assignments and skip videos if you are short on time) \n",
    "* https://course.fast.ai/index.html - fast.ai's introduction to deep learning (you'll have to pick out the bits about text and RNNs) is an efficient and effective way of tackling the topic\n",
    "* https://www.datacamp.com/courses/natural-language-processing-fundamentals-in-python - very hands on datacamp course that will let you practice using existing tools for NLP tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Some **additional tools below** that can help in NLP (if you haven't found them already):\n",
    "* scikit-learn has a handy set of features for NLP\n",
    "* https://spacy.io/ - commercially oriented python package for NLP\n",
    "* https://www.nltk.org/ - slightly more academic oriented python package for NLP \n",
