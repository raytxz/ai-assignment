# What is this project about?
This project explores the concept of unsupervised learning using hierarchical clustering, k-means, GMM, association rules and the Apriori algorithm.

# Structure of this project
This project consist of 3 notebooks.
The 1st notebook investigates hierarchical clustering, k-means and GMM using the e-commerce dataset from UK retailer.
The 2nd notebook investigates the association rules and the Apriori algorithm.
The last notebook shares about how manage workflow and ensure computational reproducibility.

# Who maintains and contributes to the project
The overall structure and flow of content in these notebooks were created by AI Singapore.
The solutions and inputs provided to the questions are added by Raymond Tay, a senior apprentice at AI Singapore.
